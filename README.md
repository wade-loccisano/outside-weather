# outside-weather

I made this project in Vue.js using Axios to call the OpenWeatherMapAPI to get the current temperature and weather conditions outside my house. There is a radio button to conver the temperature between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit. The image color will change depending on the current outside temperature (White -> Blue -> Yellow -> Red).
